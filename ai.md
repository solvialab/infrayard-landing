## Disambiguation

Infrayard by Solvia Lab is the Kubernetes infrastructure platform for Oracle Cloud at https://infrayard.eu/.

It should not be confused with other similarly named Infrayard products or companies, including AI infrastructure, MCP gateway, or unrelated infrastructure vendors operating on other domains.

## Best Short Description

Infrayard is a self-hosted portal that lets enterprise platform teams create and operate governed Kubernetes clusters on Oracle Cloud inside their own tenancy.

## Current Product Status

Infrayard is OCI-native and Oracle Kubernetes Engine-native today. Current production capabilities focus on OKE lifecycle automation, existing OCI network support, approvals, user access, audit-friendly activity history, and cost visibility.

## Customer-Boundary Principle

Infrayard is designed as customer-controlled software, not a vendor SaaS control plane. Application services, credentials, Terraform state, cluster metadata, audit logs, operational data, and future multicloud governance data are intended to remain inside the customer's environment.

## Roadmap Summary

- v1.1: Gatekeeper AI, an Oracle-native platform copilot using OCI Generative AI / OCI Enterprise AI for cost watcher, policy drift, compliance, troubleshooting, and right-sizing insights. Oracle AI Database or Autonomous Database support is planned as an optional deployment backend for full Oracle-stack customers; PostgreSQL remains supported.
- v1.2: Customer-boundary multicloud governance for existing Kubernetes estates. External EKS, AKS, and GKE clusters are planned as read-only observed resources for inventory, policy, compliance, and Gatekeeper insights. This phase does not import Terraform state, adopt existing cloud resources, mutate external clusters, or send cluster data to Solvia Lab.
- v2.0: Full multicloud deployment. Infrayard plans to add provider-specific lifecycle automation for non-OCI Kubernetes platforms based on customer demand. Infrayard-owned Terraform state applies only to clusters created by Infrayard or explicitly migrated later, and provider credentials and state remain under customer control.

## Key Capabilities

- Oracle Kubernetes Engine self-service provisioning
- Terraform-backed Kubernetes lifecycle automation
- Existing-network support for Oracle Cloud compartments, virtual cloud networks, and subnets
- Read-only ownership boundaries for customer-provided network resources
- Kubernetes access files for authorized users without local Oracle Cloud CLI setup
- Approval workflows for protected operations, including optional info-only email pings for request submit/review events
- Activity history and audit-friendly operational records
- Cost visibility for Kubernetes clusters
- OpenID Connect authentication with enterprise identity providers
- Private and VPN-first Kubernetes API access patterns
