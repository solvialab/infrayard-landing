# Infrayard by Solvia Lab

**A portal for creating and operating Kubernetes infrastructure on Oracle Cloud without making every engineer write Terraform or work directly in the Oracle Cloud Console.**

Infrayard lets platform teams define the approved ways to create Kubernetes clusters: templates, limits, networking rules, login roles, approvals, cost visibility, and audit history. Engineers request and operate clusters through the portal. Infrayard runs the infrastructure workflow underneath, using Terraform and Oracle Cloud APIs inside the customer environment.

In practical terms:

- Engineers get a simple way to create, scale, upgrade, access, and destroy Kubernetes clusters.
- Platform teams keep control over what can be created, who can use it, and which changes need approval.
- Terraform is still part of the system, but it is hidden behind governed workflows instead of becoming every user's job.
- Customer credentials, logs, and operational data stay inside the customer boundary.

## 1. Quick start

Pick the deployment path that matches your environment — both use the same Helm chart with different values files, tuned for the ingress controller, storage class, and networking model of each target.

| | **Existing OKE cluster** *(recommended for production)* | **Single-node k3s on an OCI VM** |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | Enterprise teams already running OKE | Dev/test, demos, Always Free tier |
| Ingress controller | ingress-nginx + OCI flexible Load Balancer (installed separately) | Traefik (bundled with k3s, zero setup) |
| Storage class | `oci-bv` (OCI Block Volume) | `local-path` (k3s default) |
| Image pull policy | `IfNotPresent` (OKE nodes pull from approved registry) | `Always` (single VM refresh-on-restart) |
| Scheduling | No tolerations (OKE has dedicated workers) | Control-plane tolerations (single-node scheduling) |
| Values file | `deploy/helm/values-oke.yaml` | `deploy/helm/values-k3s.yaml` |
| Chart values `ingress.className` | `nginx` | `traefik` |
| Setup time | ~30 min (cluster exists) | ~15 min |
| Guide | Available during evaluation/POC | Available during evaluation/POC |
| Testing playbook | Available during evaluation/POC | Available during evaluation/POC |

### Existing OKE cluster (recommended)

For teams that already have an OKE cluster — deploy Infrayard via Helm in minutes:

```bash
helm upgrade --install infrayard deploy/helm/ -n infrayard \
  -f deploy/helm/values-oke.yaml \
  --set global.domain=infrayard.example.com \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD \
  --set keycloak.admin.password=YOUR_KC_PASSWORD \
  --set api.oci.tenancyOcid=ocid1.tenancy... \
  --set api.oci.userOcid=ocid1.user... \
  --set api.oci.fingerprint=xx:xx:xx... \
  --set api.oci.namespace=YOUR_NAMESPACE \
  --set api.oci.parentCompartmentOcid=ocid1.compartment...
```

> Contact [hello@infrayard.eu](mailto:hello@infrayard.eu) for Helm chart access and onboarding support.

### Single-node k3s

For dev/test, demos, or OCI Always Free tier VMs. Run this on an OCI VM in the same region as your target tenancy for low-latency access to the OCI API:

```bash
helm upgrade --install infrayard deploy/helm/ -n infrayard \
  -f deploy/helm/values-k3s.yaml \
  --set global.domain=infrayard.example.com \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD \
  --set keycloak.admin.password=YOUR_KC_PASSWORD \
  --set api.oci.tenancyOcid=ocid1.tenancy... \
  --set api.oci.userOcid=ocid1.user... \
  --set api.oci.fingerprint=xx:xx:xx... \
  --set api.oci.namespace=YOUR_NAMESPACE \
  --set api.oci.parentCompartmentOcid=ocid1.compartment...
```

OCI credentials are still required — Infrayard calls the OCI API to provision OKE clusters regardless of where Infrayard itself runs. See customer onboarding runbooks (gated) for OCI service-account setup and state-backend provisioning steps.

> Contact [hello@infrayard.eu](mailto:hello@infrayard.eu) for Helm chart access and onboarding support.

### OCI Marketplace (planned)

An OCI Marketplace listing with one-click "Launch Stack" deployment is planned for a future release. In the meantime, the Helm-based deployment paths above provide the same functionality with full flexibility.

Full deployment runbook is available during evaluation/POC.

## 2. User guide

### Signing in

Infrayard uses your organisation's existing identity provider (Keycloak, Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace, or any OIDC-compliant IdP). Click **Log In** — you are redirected to your IdP's login page and returned to the portal after authentication. No separate Infrayard account is needed.

### Deploying a cluster

1. Navigate to **Deploy** from the top nav
2. *(Optional)* Select a **Cluster template** — pre-configured profiles created by your admin that pre-fill and lock resource fields (pools, nodes, CPU, RAM, storage). Choose "Custom" to configure everything manually with your account's limits enforced
3. Enter a **Cluster name** — this becomes the base name for all OCI resources (`{name}-cluster`, `{name}-vcn`, etc.)
4. Choose a **CIDR range** from the available pool — each cluster gets its own /24
5. Select a **Kubernetes version**, **VM shape**, and **Node image** (locked if the template defines them; otherwise user-selectable — image defaults to auto-select if none configured)
6. If using "Custom" mode, configure one or more **Node pools** — each pool has a name, node count, OCPU, RAM, and storage, constrained by your account's effective limits
7. *(Optional)* Use the **Advanced tab** to bring existing OCI infrastructure — your own VCN, compartment, or subnet
8. Review the **Deployment Summary** — shows all resources that will be created, plus live estimated monthly and hourly cost
9. Click **Deploy**

Infrayard runs `terraform apply` and streams the live output in the portal. The cluster appears in **My Clusters** once provisioning completes.

> The deploy form enforces your account's effective limits — maximum pools, nodes, OCPU, RAM, and storage. If a limit prevents you from deploying, submit a limit-increase request from the deploy or scale flow; admins can approve granted values into your per-user overrides.

### Scaling a cluster

1. In **My Clusters**, click **Scale** on a running cluster
2. Adjust resources per pool — nodes, OCPU, RAM, and storage
3. Add new node pools or remove existing ones as needed; new pools default their name to the cluster's bare name and accept any name that matches the standard pool-name rules (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphen, 32 chars max). Existing pool names stay immutable to keep Terraform/OKE state aligned.
4. Review the change preview and click **Apply**

Scaling behaviour depends on the cluster tier configured by your admin — see [Cluster tiers](#4-cluster-tiers).
Kubernetes version changes are handled via a separate **Upgrade** action.

### Destroying a cluster

1. In **My Clusters**, click **Destroy**
2. Infrayard runs `terraform plan -destroy` and shows the exact resources that will be removed
3. Confirm — `terraform destroy` runs and cluster-scoped OCI resources are cleaned up
4. The CIDR range is returned to the pool and available for reuse

Destroy is permanent and cannot be undone.

> **Requests workflow:** The admin **Requests** area handles both protected-cluster destroy approvals and per-user limit-increase requests. Users submit a reason instead of destroying directly or when they need higher limits; admins approve, adjust, or deny with a note. Destroy approval still opens the Terraform destroy plan before force-destroy. Limit approval writes granted values into the user's per-user overrides. Results appear in the user's Activity inbox, and SMTP-enabled installs can also send info-only email pings with requester, action, comments, and request parameters.
>
> **Destroy behavior note:** Infrayard-managed child compartments may be deleted with the cluster. External compartment overrides are retained for shared/multi-cluster setups. In Object Storage, only the destroyed cluster's `.tfstate` object is removed; the user-level prefix/folder is kept for other clusters.

### Activity

The user nav includes an **Activity** inbox with an unread badge. It persists important events across refreshes and sessions; today it records destroy-request approvals/denials, limit request submissions and reviews, TTL expiry warnings at 24h, 4h, and 1h remaining, deploy/scale/upgrade/destroy start and completion events, and admin-driven account limit changes.

### Cluster detail

Click **Details** on any cluster card to see:

- **Cluster information** — name, status, K8s version, region, CIDR, compartment, VM shape, cluster tier, estimated monthly cost, OCID
- **Node pools** — pool name, node count, OCPU, RAM, storage, and status per pool
- **Cost breakdown** — per-pool monthly cost, control plane cost (Enhanced tier), and total with hourly rate
- **Access** — kubeconfig download and SSH key download (see [Section 5](#5-access--kubeconfig-and-ssh))

---

## 3. Admin guide

Admin access is granted via your identity provider through role assignment — see customer integration docs (gated). Admins have a separate panel accessible from the top nav.

### All clusters

A full view of every cluster across all users — status, owner, CIDR, K8s version, tier, resource counts, estimated cost (monthly + hourly), and age. The stats cards show online, provisioning, upgrading k8s, destroying, failed, total, CIDRs used, and monthly spend. From this view admins can:

- Click **Details** on any cluster to open its full detail view including kubeconfig and SSH key download
- Click **Scale** on Active/Error clusters to adjust pools, nodes, and per-node resources
- Click **Upgrade k8s** on Active/Error clusters to upgrade Kubernetes version
- Click **Destroy** to destroy any cluster regardless of owner
- Click **View logs** while an operation is running or after a failure
- Click **New Cluster** to provision a cluster outside of normal user quotas

### Users & limits

Lists every user who has signed into Infrayard. For each user, admins can:

- View current cluster count and active limit
- View resolved effective limits (per-user override if set, otherwise global default)
- Click **Edit Limits** to set per-user overrides for any combination of: cluster limit, pool max, node max, OCPU, RAM, storage, and cluster tier
- Reset a user's overrides back to global defaults; direct admin limit edits and resets create user Activity notifications
- Reset all overrides at once to revert the user to global platform defaults

Limit changes take effect on the user's next page load or login — no restart required.

### Configuration

Platform-wide settings manageable at runtime — no redeployment needed:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Cluster tier | Basic (free), Enhanced (~$0.10/hr), or Both — applies to all new clusters; "Both" lets the user pick per cluster on the deploy form |
| Cluster limit | Default max active clusters per user |
| Node pool limit | Max pools per cluster |
| Nodes per pool | Max nodes per pool |
| OCPU / RAM / Storage | Max compute per node |
| CIDR pool | Add, remove, and enable/disable /24 ranges available for cluster allocation |
| VM shapes | Sync from OCI, plus add/remove/enable/disable shapes in the deploy form |
| K8s versions | Add, remove, and enable/disable Kubernetes versions |
| Node images | Add, remove, and enable/disable OCI compute images for worker node pools |

> Note: Shape and image availability is region- and tenancy-specific. In **Admin → Configuration**, use **Sync from OCI** in the VM Shapes section first, then curate/label as needed. For CLI verification, fetch current OKE node pool options in the target region:
>
> `oci ce node-pool-options get --node-pool-option-id all --profile <PROFILE>`
>
> Use the returned `shapes` and `sources` lists as the source of truth for VM shapes and node images.
>
> If **Sync from OCI** is unavailable, Infrayard keeps existing shape config unchanged and you can continue with manual curation from the CLI output above. Sync uses the API pod OCI service account credentials/policies (not the browser/user profile).
>
> K8s version freshness: OCI can publish new OKE patch versions after Infrayard is deployed. The platform now auto-syncs available OKE versions in the background (default daily) so admin config stays current without anyone clicking **Refresh from OCI**. Newly-fetched versions land disabled by default — admins still curate which versions users may deploy. **Refresh from OCI** remains available for on-demand pulls (e.g. before template reviews or upgrade waves). Upgrade recommendation pills use the latest enabled version, so stale enablement can hide available upgrades.
>
> Once a cluster's K8s version falls behind the latest enabled, a separate sweeper (default hourly) emits one Activity entry plus one email to the cluster owner per (cluster, target version) pair, so the owner is told about new upgrade options even when not actively logged in. The notification is idempotent — it does not re-fire for the same target — and the marker auto-resets after the cluster is upgraded, ready to fire again on the next enabled-version bump.
>
> Deploy form behavior: Kubernetes versions are filtered by the currently selected VM shape and region. Users only see versions that are both OCI-compatible for that shape (based on OKE node image availability) and enabled in Admin Configuration. If compatibility lookup is unavailable, the K8s list is not shown (fail-closed) and deploy is blocked until validation succeeds. If a version is missing, either enable it in Admin Configuration or choose a shape that supports it.

### Cluster templates

Dedicated admin page for creating and managing cluster templates — pre-configured profiles that appear as selectable cards on the deploy form. Templates encode:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| K8s version | Pre-selected Kubernetes version (optional — user selects if not set) |
| VM shape | Pre-selected node shape (optional) |
| Node image | Pre-selected OCI compute image (optional — auto-selects latest OKE image if not set) |
| Node pools | Pre-defined pool layout — name, node count, OCPU, RAM, storage per pool |
| Tier default | Suggested cluster tier — Basic or Enhanced (suggestion only, not enforced) |
| TTL | Optional time-to-live in hours — when reached, Infrayard automatically starts cluster destroy/cleanup |
| Destroy protection | When enabled, the "Destroy" button on the user's cluster opens a "Request destroy" modal instead. Requests land in Admin → Requests (with a live count badge in the nav) where an admin approves, reviews the destroy plan, then confirms force-destroy, or denies with a note |
| Required role | Keycloak realm role — only users with this role can see and use the template (leave empty for all users) |
| Sort order | Controls display position in the deploy form (lower numbers appear first) |

The templates table shows estimated monthly and hourly cost per template. The add/edit modal includes a live cost preview that updates as you change pools, shape, or tier.

Template modal behavior: when a VM shape is selected, the K8s dropdown is filtered to versions OCI reports as compatible for that shape in the current region (node-image-backed compatibility). If compatibility lookup is unavailable, no fallback list is shown (fail-closed). Template save/update re-validates shape+K8s compatibility and blocks incompatible combinations.

**Environment-tier gating** — use `required_role` to control which teams can deploy which cluster sizes. For example, create a `DEV — Small` template visible to everyone, a `TEST — Medium` template requiring a `testing` role, a `UAT — Large` template requiring a `uat` role, and a `PROD — HA` template requiring a `production` role. Users only see the templates they have access to on the deploy form. Create the roles in Keycloak under **Realm roles** and assign them to the relevant users.

Templates can be created, edited, enabled/disabled, and permanently deleted. Disabled templates no longer appear in the deploy form but remain referenced by existing clusters. Permanently deleting a template removes it from the admin panel entirely.

### Requests

Approval queue for user-submitted destroy requests on protection-enabled clusters and limit-increase requests for per-user overrides. The admin nav shows live request count badges that refresh every 5 seconds (hidden when zero pending). Filter by Pending / Approved / Denied / All. Each pending row has a **Review** action. When SMTP is configured, request submit/review events also send info-only email pings: admins get submit notifications, and users get submit/approve/deny notifications.

For destroy requests, the review modal lets the admin:
- Add an optional admin note
- Click **Approve & review plan** — the normal destroy plan opens. After the admin confirms the plan, the request is marked `approved` and `force=true` destroy starts. Audit-logged as `destroy-request:approve`.
- Click **Deny** — the note is surfaced on the user's cluster card as a red "Destroy denied" pill (with the note in the tooltip). Audit-logged as `destroy-request:deny`.

For limit requests, the review modal lets the admin grant the requested values or adjust them before approval. Approved values are written into the user's per-user overrides and the user receives an Activity notification. Denials can include an admin note and are audit-logged as `limit-request:deny`. Request emails include the requester, request id, comment, requested values, and granted values where applicable.

Approval is row-locked to prevent two admins double-approving. Bypass path: admins can still force-destroy any protected cluster directly via `?force=true` from the All Clusters table — useful for incident response.

### Audit Log

Every provisioning, scaling, upgrade, and destroy operation is recorded with user identity, operation type, cluster name, outcome, and duration — including `destroy-request:*` and `limit-request:*` events from the Requests queue. The log is append-only and filterable by user, operation, and date range.

## 4. Cluster tiers

The admin configures which cluster tier(s) the platform allows: **Basic only**, **Enhanced only**, or **Both**. When a single tier is allowed, users see it as an informational indicator on the deploy form. When **Both** is allowed, the deploy form shows a tier picker so each user picks per cluster — useful when one team wants free/dev clusters and another wants production-grade scaling, all served by the same platform.

| | Basic | Enhanced |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Free | ~$0.10/hr per cluster |
| Node scaling | ⚠️ Full — add/remove nodes or pools is automatic; resource-profile changes require manual cycling | ✅ Full in-place |
| Cluster Autoscaler | ❌ | ✅ |
| Best for | Dev/test, cost-sensitive teams | Production, automated scaling |

**Basic cluster scaling:** Both Basic and Enhanced clusters support full scaling — nodes, OCPU, RAM, and storage. In Basic clusters, adding/removing nodes or node pools is automatic and does not require manual rotation. Manual cycling is required when changing per-node resources (shape, OCPU, RAM, storage), and is also recommended after a Kubernetes upgrade so workers pick up the new target image/version.

**OKE → Cluster → Node Pool → Nodes → Cordon & drain → Terminate**

Recommended rolling cycle for each affected Basic node pool (current size = `N`):
1. Scale from `N` to `2N`
2. Wait until the additional `N` nodes are `Ready/Active`
3. Scale back from `2N` to `N` (OKE removes extra nodes automatically)
4. Verify workloads and node health before moving to the next pool

The portal shows tier-specific warnings/messages for this flow.

**Kubernetes version upgrades:** Use **Upgrade k8s** on a running cluster. This updates the control plane and node-pool target Kubernetes/image configuration:
- Direct upgrades are limited to the same or next minor version (for example `1.33.x -> 1.34.x`; not `1.33.x -> 1.35.x`).
- Basic: perform rolling worker refresh per pool (`N -> 2N -> N`) after nodes become `Ready/Active`; the Upgrade modal shows live per-pool steps based on current node counts.
- Enhanced: rollout is fully automated (control plane plus worker refresh), no manual cycling required.

**Switching tiers:** Admins can switch the platform tier at any time in Configuration — Basic, Enhanced, or Both. The change applies to all new clusters; existing clusters retain the tier they were provisioned with.

**Per-user tier override:** Admins can pin a specific user to Basic or to Enhanced, regardless of the global setting. The override is force-only (single tier per user); a user without an override inherits whatever the global setting allows, including the per-cluster picker when the global is **Both**.

---

## 5. Resource limits

Limits cascade: global config sets the baseline for all users, per-user overrides take precedence when set.

| Limit | Global default | Per-user override |
|---|---|---|
| Clusters per user | Inherited from config | ✅ |
| Node pools per cluster | 3 | ✅ |
| Nodes per pool | 3 | ✅ |
| OCPU per node | 1 | ✅ |
| RAM per node | 12 GB | ✅ |
| Storage per node | 50 GB | ✅ |
| Cluster tier | BASIC_CLUSTER | ✅ |

The deploy form always reflects the user's current effective limits. If a user hits a limit, the form shows a clear message with a link to contact support. Limits can be raised at any time by an admin without restarting the platform.

---

## 6. Access — kubeconfig and SSH

### Kubeconfig

Available on the cluster detail page once the cluster is running. The default download is a universal kubeconfig with an embedded per-user ServiceAccount token, so users only need `kubectl` — no OCI CLI, local OCI config, or plugins. The explicit `/kubeconfig-oci` endpoint remains available for power users who prefer OCI CLI exec auth.

> **Network reachability still applies.** The universal kubeconfig solves authentication, not routing. The user's machine and the Infrayard runner must be able to reach the OKE Kubernetes API on TCP/6443. The recommended no-DRG/no-LPG model is a public OKE API endpoint restricted to Infrayard runner and company VPN/corporate CIDRs. A future in-cluster agent removes the direct endpoint requirement.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/oke-myname-cluster-kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get nodes
```

Admins can download the kubeconfig for any cluster from **All Clusters → Details**.

### SSH key

The SSH private key for cluster nodes is generated by Terraform at provisioning time and made available on the cluster detail page.

> ⚠️ **Save the SSH key when you first see it.** Store it in a safe location — for security it may not be retrievable after the first download.

```bash
ssh -i ~/oke-myname-cluster-key.pem opc@<node-private-ip>
```

Admins can download SSH keys for any cluster from **All Clusters → Details**.

---

## 7. Networking

### Default setup

By default, Infrayard creates a full network stack per cluster:

- A **VCN** with a /16 range derived from the cluster's /24 CIDR
- A **private worker subnet** (/24)
- A **public Kubernetes API endpoint subnet** when public restricted API access is enabled
- A **public load balancer subnet** for Kubernetes `LoadBalancer` services
- Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Service Gateway, and route tables for public/private paths
- Security lists with OKE-required ingress/egress rules plus API endpoint TCP/6443 allowlist rules

### Kubernetes API endpoint access

Admin Configuration includes **Kubernetes API Access**:

- **Private endpoint** keeps the OKE API on a private subnet. Infrayard and kubectl clients need an existing private route, VPN, or bastion path.
- **Public endpoint restricted by CIDR allowlist** creates a dedicated public API endpoint subnet and allows TCP/6443 only from configured CIDRs. Add both the Infrayard runner egress IP/range and company VPN/corporate egress ranges. `0.0.0.0/0` is rejected.

This is the supported path when DRG is too costly and LPG does not scale past the per-VCN peering limit. Users still need to be on the corporate/VPN network for `kubectl`.

### Bringing your own network

Users can supply existing OCIDs via the **Advanced tab** in the deploy form. Infrayard skips creating whichever resources are already provided:

| Override | Effect |
|---|---|
| Existing VCN OCID | Uses your VCN — skips VCN, IGW, gateway, and route table creation; generated subnets use the VCN's existing/default routing |
| Existing Compartment OCID | Places resources in your compartment — skips compartment creation |
| Existing Subnet OCID | Places nodes in your subnet — requires Existing VCN OCID, and skips subnet and security list creation |

Supported private-endpoint combinations:

| Combination | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No overrides | Infrayard creates and manages the compartment, VCN, subnets, gateways, route tables, and security lists |
| Existing Compartment OCID only | Infrayard creates a new managed VCN/network stack inside that compartment |
| Existing VCN OCID, with or without Existing Compartment OCID | Infrayard reuses the VCN and creates cluster subnets/security lists inside it; existing VCN gateways and route tables are not managed |
| Existing VCN OCID + Existing Subnet OCID, with or without Existing Compartment OCID | True BYON networking: Infrayard creates OKE/node-pool resources and references the supplied network read-only |
| Existing Subnet OCID without Existing VCN OCID | Unsupported and rejected before Terraform starts |

**Compartment subtree rule.** `Existing Compartment OCID` must be a descendant (any depth) of the **anchor compartment** chosen at install time — the compartment Infrayard uses as the parent for new cluster compartments. The anchor is whatever existing compartment you point us at; it does not have to be a dedicated Infrayard-owned compartment. Direct children, grandchildren, and the anchor itself are all accepted. Siblings, ancestors, or compartments in unrelated subtrees are rejected with a 400 *before* Terraform starts — without this guard the deploy would fail mid-`terraform apply` with a confusing IAM error, because the runner's `manage` policies are scoped to the anchor subtree. Non-existent OCIDs return "compartment not found"; if OCI is briefly unreachable for the validation call, the API returns 503 so the deploy can simply be retried.

The anchor is a knob, not a fixture. Pick the layout that matches your tenancy posture:

- **Tenancy root anchor.** No new compartments, nothing to rearrange — the entire tenancy is BYON-eligible. Right for "we don't want Infrayard adding any hierarchy on top of what we already have." Trade-off: the runner's IAM group needs `manage` permissions at tenancy scope (or scoped to the relevant resource families).
- **Anchor at an existing org compartment.** Slot Infrayard into a `platforms`, `production`, or `infra` compartment you already maintain. BYON works for anything under it, including peer compartments that already existed there. You don't have to create a new compartment to enable Infrayard.
- **Dedicated anchor compartment.** Create one (e.g. `infrayard`) for explicit blast-radius isolation. Functionally identical to the previous case, just a narrower IAM scope.

The single-install pattern that's *not* supported today is "one Infrayard spanning multiple unrelated subtrees of the same tenancy." That posture requires either tenancy-wide grants (use the tenancy-root anchor) or two installs.

Restricted public API endpoint mode requires Infrayard-managed networking when `Existing VCN OCID` or `Existing Subnet OCID` would otherwise make the network read-only.

Important behavior: `Existing Compartment OCID` does **not** auto-discover an existing VCN or subnet from that compartment. If VCN/subnet fields are left empty, Infrayard creates a new VCN/subnets/network stack inside the provided compartment.

Advanced override UX guardrails: OCID fields validate type prefixes (`ocid1.vcn.`, `ocid1.compartment.`, `ocid1.subnet.`) and provide OCI-backed autocomplete lists for compartments, VCNs, and subnets.

> Shared compartment guidance: if you want multiple clusters in one compartment, use a dedicated BYO compartment via `Existing Compartment OCID` for all those clusters. Do not reuse a compartment that was auto-created for another cluster as a shared target.

> Note: If you deploy with existing VCN/subnet overrides, Infrayard does not manage route tables for those existing resources. Your existing network must already provide equivalent private-subnet egress required for OKE worker node registration: route `0.0.0.0/0` to a NAT Gateway (or equivalent corporate egress path) and route `all-<region>-services-in-oracle-services-network` to a Service Gateway. This is a routing requirement, not an "open ingress" security rule.

> ⚠️ **Drift behaviour.** Infrayard-created VCN, subnet, IGW, route table, and security list resources are fully managed by the cluster's Terraform state — manual edits in the OCI Console will be overwritten on the next apply. Supplied BYO resources (existing VCN / subnet / compartment) are referenced read-only and never modified.

### Custom security rules

Infrayard's default security list covers the ports required by OKE. For custom ingress/egress rules — exposing specific node ports, restricting egress to corporate CIDRs, or integrating with existing NSGs — the recommended approach is to **bring your own subnet** via the Advanced tab with your security configuration already applied. Infrayard uses your subnet and skips creating its own security list entirely, giving your network team full control without adding UI complexity.

## 8. Testing & CI

### Running tests

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

160 automated tests covering user provisioning, limit resolution and limit requests, admin config CRUD, cluster templates, cost estimation, access control (kubeconfig + SSH key), lifecycle notifications, request emails, admin-action owner emails, K8s upgrade-recommendation sweeper, and API contracts. Tests run against an in-memory SQLite database with mocked authentication — no external services required.

### CI pipeline (maintainer-owned)

Infrayard includes maintainer CI on GitHub and GitLab. GitHub Actions is the single release publisher for GHCR, GitLab Container Registry, and OCIR; GitLab CI is validation-only. Customer operators typically do not run these pipelines - they deploy versioned images from GHCR, OCIR, GitLab Container Registry, or an internal mirror.

**GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

| Job | What it validates |
|---|---|
| `test` | 160 Python unit tests with coverage |
| `helm-lint` | Helm lint + template rendering (default + k3s + OKE values) |
| `docker-build-push` | Build + push the same images to GHCR, GitLab Container Registry, and OCIR |
| `terraform-validate` | Core module and runner template |

**GitLab CI** (`.gitlab-ci.yml`):

| Job | What it validates |
|---|---|
| `test` | 160 Python unit tests with coverage |
| `helm-lint` | Helm lint + template rendering (default + k3s + OKE values) |
| `terraform-validate` | Core module and runner template |

The release publisher uses the same channel tags across all three registries: `dev-latest` for `DEV`, `latest` for `main`, and exact `v*` release tags. GHCR is canonical, and GitLab Container Registry plus OCIR are 1:1 mirrors from the same build. The Helm chart's `imagePullSecrets` support makes this work with any private container registry.
